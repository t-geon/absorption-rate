# absorption-rate

input = The value that flows through the human body
output = value flowing out of a person's body

This is a project to find x, the absorption rate of the human body, using input and output.

The project can be easily solved by thinking of it as a linear inverse problem.
Conceptually, the absorption rate of the human body cannot be measured, so it is guessed by the signal code and the resulting value.
it can be easily solved by thinking of Ax=b.

A is an input value as a signal code, and b is an output value.
Ax=b can be found by using the slu and slv functions when A and b are known.

At Ax=b, matrix a, which serves as matrix A, is a 20x20 matrix.
The values in each row are inputs generated by different frequencies entering the same time period.
For example, row 1,column 1 of a are the input value (the value that flows through the body) made at 11 Hz in 0.01 sec.
Rows 1 and 2 are input values made at 12 Hz in 0.01 sec.
In this way, all input values are initialized to a.

The output serving b at Ax=b is in the given output.mat file.
To use it, you need to use the load function.
That is, load('output.mat') takes the value in output.mat.
By applying the above a and output to the slu and slv functions, x can be obtained.

inv함수를 이용해 xx를 구했습니다.
Ax=b를 이용해 설명하겠습니다.
Ax=b에서 A의 역행렬을 양변에 곱해줍니다. 
-> Ax=b이 x=A의 역행렬* b가 됩니다.
Inv는 행렬의 역행렬을 구해주는 함수로 x = A의 역행렬* b와 xx = inv(a) * output은 같습니다.
저는 a * xx를 한 값을 out2에 넣어줬습니다.
